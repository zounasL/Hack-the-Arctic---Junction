# Challenge: Map the Arctic
------

Arctic Fox brings the issues of climate change closer to you. Happenings are updated through real life data and your mission s to help the spieces survive. Remember that fixing one problem may cause another. Adjusting the levels of temperature, CO2 and sea level are key issues. 

# Description
------

Simulating arctic data through gamified solution showing issues about climate change close to people. The main idea is to helping people understand what is the cause-effect relationship for some environmental event.

# Issue
------

Issue is that there is a large amount of scientific data, that is not comprehensible for non-researcher people.

The impact of this solution is that it highlights the environmental aspects for everyone, and thus is geared towards changing people's mindsets. It diffuses and spreads climate information in comprehensive form in order to influence the activities of people. It also shows clearly the effects of climate change.
